Map Properties
..............


In the map properties box you can specify :guilabel:`Width` and :guilabel:`Height`, as well as background :guilabel:`Color` and the :guilabel:`CRS` of the single map canvases.
Click :guilabel:`Apply` to apply changes. By default the :guilabel:`keep ratio` option is |cbc| checked, i.e. height will be the same as width. In case
you want to have unequally sized views, deactivate this option.

.. * :guilabel:`Set Center` center the QGIS Map View to the same coordinate as the EO TSV Map View
.. * :guilabel:`Get Center` center the EO TSV Map View to the same coordinate as the QGIS Map View
.. * :guilabel:`Set Extent` zoom the QGIS Map View to the same extent as the EO TSV Map View
.. * :guilabel:`Get Extent` zoom the EO TSV Map View to the same extent as the QGIS Map View
.. * ``Load center profile``, when checked |cbc|, the temporal profile of the center pixel will automatically be displayed and updated in the :ref:`Profile View` tab.


Map Views
.........

A map view is a row of map canvases that show the time series images of different sensors/product in the same band combination, e.g. as "True Color bands".
The map view panel allows to add or remove map views and to specifiy how the images of each sensor are to be rendered.


* You can *add new Map Views* using the |mActionAddMapView| button. This will create a new row of map canvases. Remove a map view with the |mActionRemoveMapView| button.
* In case the Map View does not refresh correctly, you can 'force' the refresh using the |mActionRefresh| button (which will also apply all the render settings).
* Access the settings for individual Map Views by clicking in the mapview |mapviewbutton|
* You can use the |questionmark| button to highlight the current Map View selected in the dropdown menu (respective image chips will show red margin for a few seconds).


For every Map View you can alter the following settings:

* *Hide/Unhide* the Map View via the |mapviewHidden| :superscript:`Toggle visibility of this map view` button.

* *Activate/Deactivate Crosshair* via the |crosshair| :superscript:`Show/hide a crosshair` button. Press the arrow button next to it to enter
  the *Crosshair specifications* |symbology| , where you can customize e.g. color, opacity, thickness, size and further options.

* You may rename the Map View by altering the text in the :guilabel:`Name` field.

.. * **Vector Rendering** allows you to visualize vector data (e.g. a shapefile). In order to do so, open the file in QGIS. Once loaded in the QGIS Layers Panel, it will become selectable
..  in the dropdown menu. Vector styling will be same as in QGIS (i.e. if you want to adjust it, do it in QGIS). Check |cbc| or uncheck |cbu| in order to activate/deactivate Vector Rendering.
Furthermore, you can visualize the locations of :ref:`Temporal Profiles` or :ref:`Spectral Profiles <Spectral Library>` as points. Select the desired option
from the dropdown list.

**Layer representation:**


* Similar to QGIS you can change the visual representation of raster or vector layers in the layer properties. To open them,
  right-click on the layer you want to alter and select :menuselection:`Set Properties --> Style`
