2016-12-02: Work on this project continued. During the last months I focused on
the [EnMAP-Box](https://bitbucket.org/hu-geomatics/enmap-box) where I gained a lot of experience in using Qt and QGIS API.
Referring to this, I created the [qgis_api](/branch/qgis_api) which contains the most recent developments.
