EO Time Series Viewer
======================

The Earth Observation Time Series Viewer (EOTSV) is a free-and-open source QGIS Plugin to visualize and label
raster-based earth observation time series data.

Features
--------

* Raster images can be added to the time series without homogenisation of spatial extent or coordinate reference system. Time stamps are extracted automatically from (i) image meta data ("acquisition date"), (ii) the file name or (iii) the file directory path.
* Raster IO uses the `Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) <http://www.gdal.org>`_, which supports up to 142 `different raster formats <http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html>`_.
* Distinguished sensors by pixel size and number of bands and, if available, band wavelength information and sensor name.
* Spatial-temporal ("maps") visualisation allows to show multiples band combinations in parallel, e.g. True Color and coloured infrared.
* Color stretches are applied to all raster images of same sensor and band combination. This helps to optimise color stretches for multiple images in a minimum of time.
* Spectral-temporal ("time profile") visualisation shows raw or scaled, sensor specific band values.
