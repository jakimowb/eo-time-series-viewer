The EO Time Series Viewer is a QGIS Plugin to visualize and label Earth Observation (EO) time series data.

Features:

<ul>
<li>visualization of time series data in spatially synchronized maps</li>
<li>map views visualize different band combinations in parallel, e.g. True Color and SWIR bands</li>
<li>multi-sensor support: each sensor has its own visualization settings</li>
<li>easy definition of time series: just use a common "Open File" dialog</li>
<li>labeling of time series in interaction with QGIS</li>
<li>extraction of Spectral Profiles and export as Spectral Library</li>
<li>extraction of Temporal Profiles for single bands or spectral indices (on-the-fly calculation)</li>
</ul>

Dependencies:

    pyqtgraph (required), PyOpenGL (optional)

    install with "python -m pip pyqtgraph"


The EO Time Series Viewer is developed at Geomatics Lab, Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin.

Earlier versions of the EO Time Series Viewer were partly developed in the SenseCarbon project,
funded by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and granted by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research
(BMBF, grant no. 50EE1254). Since 2017 development of the software is supported by the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) as
part of the EnMAP Core Science Team activities, funded by DLR and granted by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi, grant no. 50EE1529),
and the Land Use Monitoring System (LUMOS) project, funded by the Belgian Science Policy Office as part of
the Stereo-III research program (grant no. SR/01/349).
