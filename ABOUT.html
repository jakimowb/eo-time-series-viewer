Earlier versions of the EO Time Series Viewer were partly developed in the SenseCarbon project,
funded by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and granted by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research
(BMBF, grant no. 50EE1254). Since 2017 development of the software is supported by the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) as
part of the EnMAP Core Science Team activities, funded by DLR and granted by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi, grant no. 50EE1529),
and the Land Use Monitoring System (LUMOS) project, funded by the Belgian Science Policy Office as part of
the Stereo-III research program (grant no. SR/01/349).
