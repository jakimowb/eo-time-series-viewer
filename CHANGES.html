<ul>
<li>changing the map coordinate reference system (CRS) to one that is obviously not suited for
the data might cause system crashes</li>

<li>Temporal Profile Visualization:<ul>
<li>sensor/product plot settings like the band/spectral index, plot symbol and colors are restored after restart</li>
<li>profile loading speed increased by loading required bands only</li>
<li>profile values are loaded in a parallel process</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Map Visualization: progress bars indicate if map data is loaded in background</li>
<li>Sensor/product names are restored after restart</li>
<li>Pixel profiles are now loaded in a parallel process that will not block the UI (required because of python GIL.)</li>
</ul>
