The SenseCarbon TimeSeriesViewer is tool to visualize raster file based time series data.
Its major aims are: 

(i) to support labeling of time series data based on [Quantum GIS (QGIS)](www.qgis.org)

(ii) to use remote sensing imagery "as is", i.e. support each raster format that is read by QGIS

(iii) an almost platform independent installation

Please check the [Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/jakimowb/sensecarbontsviewer/wiki/Home) for more information.
