The SenseCarbon Time Series Viewer can be used to visualize time series of remote sensing data.
Its major aims are: 

(i) to support a [Quantum GIS (QGIS)](www.qgis.org) based labeling of time series data, 

(ii) to use the remote sensing imagery "as is" 

(iii) to avoid a complicated installation process
